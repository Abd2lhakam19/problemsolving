## Codeforces contests

<br><br>

## Overview
This repository shall contain all (almost all) of the codeforces rounds for Div1, Div2, Div3 and Div4 from 2023.

You may find unsolved problems, which you can contribute and solve them of course.

## Contribution
***Who can contribute***
- You will add your own solution to an unsolved or already solved problems
- You will edit README file and add better description, overview... etc to the repo.
- You won't edit other people's solutions
- You will report any issues or enhacements

***These steps to how to make a contribution to this Repo***

- Follow the same style in the repo
    1. Fork the repo first
    1. Follow the following guidelines:
        1. Open the folder of the div difficulty like (Div4 ,Div3 ,Div2)
        1. Open the folder of the problem like(A. Codeforces Checking)
        1. Make a file of your solution and follow this pattern `<problem no.>  <name of problem> (<your name>).<file extension>`
            - for example `A. Codeforces Checking (Asemhisham).cpp`
        1. Put this line as a comment on the top of your file: ``// Author: <your name>``
        1. Try to write comments to explain your solution
        1. Redundant solutions will be rejected
    1. Create a pull request here after that
    1. You are highly advised to have the same coding style in all your soluions. People will just know how the code will look by knowing it is your solution (Like `Asem` usually adds a lot of macros and `Abdullah` writes more C-like code)

## Rules
1-Don't push a solution during the contest
